These are the files for the video game precision pilot.
It is being developed in June 2013 for the one game a month challenge.

As it stands currently, the goal of this game is to take some of the playstyles of Robo Rally and adjust them to fit a one player, puzzle game style.

The viewpoint of the game is from above.  The game stars a small, yet to be named ship, who flies at a low level on a planet, attempting to get to it's home base.

Movement is done using supplied moves in the correct order to get from point a to point b, avoiding traps and walls.
